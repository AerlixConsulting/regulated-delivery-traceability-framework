## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by emailing [security@aerlixconsulting.com](mailto:security@aerlixconsulting.com). Alternatively, you can open a private GitHub security advisory.

We will evaluate and respond as soon as possible to coordinate a resolution.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain the `main` branch. Please ensure you test against the latest version before reporting an issue.

## Security Practices

- Secrets are not committed to this repository. Use environment variables or secrets management tools.
- Dependencies are managed and monitored. We run security scans on dependencies and container images.
- Code scanning is enabled to detect common vulnerabilities.
- Audit logging and traceability are built into the framework.
